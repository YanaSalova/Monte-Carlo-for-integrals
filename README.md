# Monte-Carlo-for-integrals
This repository implements and analyzes one-dimensional integrals using the Monte Carlo method. Tasks include verifying integral convergence, implementing Monte Carlo integration for arbitrary densities, examining the order of convergence for uniform densities, and selecting optimal integrating densities.
