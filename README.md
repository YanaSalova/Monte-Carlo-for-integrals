Tasks include verifying integral convergence, implementing Monte Carlo integration for arbitrary densities, examining the order of convergence for uniform densities, and selecting optimal integrating densities.

# One-Dimensional Integrals

This repository contains code and documentation for evaluating one-dimensional integrals using the Monte Carlo method. Specifically, it focuses on the following tasks:

## Tasks

1. **Convergence Verification**
   - Ensure that the given integral converges.

2. **Monte Carlo Integration Procedure**
   - Implement the Monte Carlo integration method for arbitrary integrating densities. Validate that the procedure provides correct results.

3. **Order of Convergence**
   - For integrals with finite limits, verify the order of convergence of the Monte Carlo procedure using a uniform integrating density.

4. **Optimal Integrating Densities**
   - Experiment with different integrating densities and select the optimal one in terms of convergence speed and variance of the estimate. Justify the choice.

## Example Integral
Evaluate the following integral as an example:

$$\int_{0}^{\pi} e^{-\cos(x + \tan x)} \, dx $$
